## Part 1: The Role of the Product Owner

### Creating a Clear Project Description

The Product Owner's first responsibility is to create a detailed Project Description document. This document must clearly explain the features of the module, leaving no room for ambiguity. It serves as a blueprint, outlining the project's objectives, features, and expectations.

### Scheduling an Introduction Meeting

Once the Project Description is prepared, the Product Owner schedules an introduction meeting. This meeting is crucial for presenting their vision, explaining the project's goals, and garnering interest from the team. Itâ€™s an opportunity for the Product Owner to inspire and engage the team with their idea.

## Part 2: Role Call and Team Formation

### Registration for Roles

Following the introduction meeting, the project opens up for role registration. Team members can sign up for various roles, such as Developer, Expert Advisor, or Organizer, based on their skills and interests. This Role Call is vital for forming a well-rounded team equipped to handle the project's needs.

----------

## Part 3: Task List Creation and Milestone Planning

### Collaborative Planning

The Technical Officer, in collaboration with Developers and Expert Advisors, undertakes the task of breaking down the development phase into manageable milestones. This step includes the creation of a comprehensive task list for the first milestone, ensuring alignment with the Design Guidelines.

----------

## Part 4: Task Allocation and Execution

### Updating the GitHub Project Board

The Organizer then updates the GitHub Project Board with all the planned tasks. At this stage, Developers who registered for the project can pick tasks and start working on them, adhering to the established Contribution Guidelines.

----------

## Part 5: Milestone Completion and Iteration

### Iterative Development Process

After completing a milestone, the process circles back to the Technical Officer. They facilitate the development of tasks for the next milestone. This iterative process continues until the module is fully implemented, ensuring a consistent and structured development flow.

----------

## Part 6: Issue Management and Coordination

### Overseeing Development Challenges

Throughout the development process, the Project Coordinator plays a crucial role in managing any issues that arise. They ensure that challenges are addressed efficiently and do not hinder the project's progress. Their management skills are key to maintaining smooth operations during development.
