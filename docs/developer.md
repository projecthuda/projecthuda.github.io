### Taking on Tasks in the Project

A Developer's primary responsibility is to take on tasks from the project. This involves more than just coding; it requires understanding the specifics of each task, its role within the larger project, and how it aligns with the project's overall goals. Developers are responsible for selecting tasks that match their skill set and expertise from the GitHub Project Board or a similar task management system.

Once a task is taken on, the Developer is responsible for executing it according to the project's requirements. This includes writing code, conducting initial testing, debugging, and adhering to the project's coding standards and guidelines. Developers collaborate with other project members, such as Expert Designers, to ensure that the technical implementation aligns with the design and functional requirements.

Developers are also involved in code reviews and may participate in discussions about the project's direction and implementation strategies. Their technical insight is invaluable in identifying potential challenges and proposing solutions.
