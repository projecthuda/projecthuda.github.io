### Receiving Tasks from the Technical Officer

The organizer starts by receiving tasks from the Technical Officer. This involves understanding the technical requirements, timelines, and priorities. The organizer ensures that each task aligns with the project's overall objectives and is clear for implementation by the development team.

### Organizing Tasks on the GitHub Project Board

Once tasks are received, the organizer's responsibility is to organize them on the GitHub Project Board. This involves categorizing tasks, setting priorities, and making sure each task is clearly described and assigned. The goal is to create a transparent and easy-to-navigate workflow for the development team.

### Managing Task Completion and Board Maintenance

The organizer is responsible for monitoring the progress of tasks and updating the Project Board accordingly. This includes tracking the completion of tasks, updating their status on the board, and ensuring that the board reflects the current state of the project. This continuous management is vital for keeping the project on track.

### Ensuring Adherence to Contribution Guidelines

A crucial part of the organizer's role is to ensure that developers follow the set contribution guidelines. This includes code standards, commit conventions, and workflow processes. The organizer reviews contributions for compliance and works with developers to resolve any issues, maintaining a consistent and quality-driven development process.

### Updating the Community

Regular updates to the community about the project's progress and next steps are an essential responsibility of the organizer. This involves communicating what has been done, what is currently being worked on, and what tasks are upcoming. These updates are key for maintaining transparency and engagement with all stakeholders.
