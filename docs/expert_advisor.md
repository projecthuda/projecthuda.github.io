### Providing Assistance to Developers and the Technical Officer

One of the primary responsibilities of the Expert Advisor is to provide assistance to Developers and the Technical Officer. This involves offering guidance and support in implementing design elements and ensuring that they align with the technical requirements and overall vision of the project. The Expert Advisor acts as a bridge between the conceptual design and its technical execution, helping developers understand and implement the design effectively.

### Identifying Potential Issues in Software Architecture

The Expert Advisor plays a crucial role in identifying potential issues in software architecture. This responsibility goes beyond mere aesthetics; it involves a thorough understanding of software architecture principles and how design decisions impact the functionality and scalability of the project. The Expert Advisor proactively analyses the proposed architecture and highlights any concerns or areas that may require reevaluation or adjustment, thereby contributing to the project's long-term stability and success.

### Power to Vote on Code Acceptance

Another significant role of the Expert Advisor is having the power to vote on code acceptance. This authority ensures that the implementation of designs and related code not only meets functional requirements but also adheres to the intended design and user experience standards. The Expert Advisor reviews code submissions, particularly those impacting the user interface and experience, to ensure they align with the project's design principles and quality standards.
