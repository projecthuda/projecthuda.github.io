### Facilitating Meetings According to Meeting Guidelines

A primary responsibility of the Project Coordinator is to facilitate meetings. This involves more than just scheduling and conducting meetings; it's about ensuring that each meeting is productive, efficient, and in line with the Meeting Guidelines. These guidelines typically cover aspects such as the meeting's purpose, duration, expected outcomes, and participant roles. The Project Coordinator ensures that meetings are focused, time-efficient, and result in clear action items or decisions, thereby contributing to the project's progress.

### Controlling the General Flow of the Project According to Development Guidelines

Another critical aspect of the Project Coordinator's role is to control the general flow of the project. This involves monitoring the progress of the project and ensuring that it aligns with the Development Guidelines. These guidelines may encompass various aspects of the project, such as development phases, quality standards, timeline adherence, and resource allocation. The Project Coordinator works closely with team members, including the Technical Officer and Organizer, to ensure that the project stays on track, adheres to its planned trajectory, and meets the set standards and objectives.
