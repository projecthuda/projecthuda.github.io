### Receiving Project Description and Creating Task List and Milestones

The key responsibility involves receiving the project description from the Product Owner. The Technical Officer then translates this description into a detailed task list and defines the project milestones. This process is critical in converting the project vision and objectives into actionable tasks and achievable segments. After creating this detailed breakdown, the Technical Officer then communicates it to the Organizer, setting the stage for the project's execution.


### Providing Design Guidelines for the Project

The Technical Officer is also responsible for providing design guidelines for the project. These guidelines are essential in maintaining a consistent and cohesive design approach throughout the project. The design guidelines typically cover aspects like coding standards, architectural patterns, UI/UX principles, and other technical specifications. By setting these guidelines, the Technical Officer ensures that all team members are on the same page and that the project adheres to industry standards and best practices.

### Power to Vote on Code Acceptance

Finally, the Technical Officer holds the power to vote on code acceptance. This responsibility is crucial in maintaining the quality and integrity of the project. The Technical Officer reviews the code submissions, ensuring they meet the project's standards and requirements. The power to accept or reject code submissions is a significant aspect of maintaining technical excellence and ensuring that the project's deliverables are of the highest quality.
