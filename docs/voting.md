**Informed Democracy Voting Rules**

**Part 1: Identifying the Problem** In a recent tech stack vote, it was noted that the majority of votes were based on familiarity rather than informed decision-making. This underscores the need for a voting process that is more structured and informed.

**Part 2: Voting Setting and Information Provision** To facilitate an informed decision-making process, the project staff must clearly communicate the complexities and relevant issues of the voting subject. This information, comprehensive and accessible, should be provided alongside the voting announcement in the #voting channel. The aim is to equip the community with essential knowledge for making informed choices.

**Part 3: Voter Responsibility and Accountability** Voters are obligated to thoroughly understand the aspects and implications of the voting subject, educating themselves about the points stated in the provided resources. When casting a vote, members must post their reasoning in the #voting channel. Votes lacking a supporting rationale, aligned with these guidelines, will be deemed invalid. This ensures that each vote reflects informed judgment, fostering a more thoughtful decision-making process.

**Part 4: Retort Mechanics** Every vote is subject to counterarguments or rebuttals by any community member. However, these rebuttals must directly address the content of the original vote and should include tangible, specific, and measurable points. If a vote is challenged, the original voter is required to defend their reasoning for their vote to be upheld. This mechanism encourages deeper engagement and ensures that each vote withstands critical scrutiny, enhancing the overall quality of the decision-making process.
